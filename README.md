## Context:

Tic Tac Toe, a timeless classic in the realm of strategy games, has etched its place in gaming history since its inception. Originating as a paper-and-pencil game, Tic Tac Toe has seamlessly transitioned into the digital era, maintaining its allure across generations. Players engage in a battle of wits on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a line of three of their respective symbols – X or O – horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The elegance of Tic Tac Toe lies in its straightforward rules, as players take turns placing their symbols on the grid, attempting to outmaneuver their opponent.

Tic Tac Toe's digital adaptation has proliferated through various platforms, from early computer systems to modern mobile devices. Its presence on mobile phones, akin to Snake's inclusion on Nokia devices, has made it a ubiquitous part of the gaming landscape. The intuitive touch controls or mouse clicks allow players to effortlessly make their moves, adding to the game's accessibility. Despite its apparent simplicity, Tic Tac Toe's enduring popularity can be attributed to its strategic nuances and the thrill of outsmarting opponents. Whether played on a piece of paper or a high-tech device, Tic Tac Toe remains a symbol of gaming's timeless charm, providing entertainment and mental stimulation for players worldwide.
